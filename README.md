Zapfhahn
=======

This is my personal collection of formulae for Homebrew. They are either very special to my use cases or just not well tested enough for the default homebrew tap.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

Just `brew tap Marvin182/zapfhahn` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install Marvin182/zapfhahn/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marvin182/homebrew-zapfhahn/master/<formula>.rb
```
